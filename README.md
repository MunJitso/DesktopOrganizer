# Folder Organizer
a C project to organize your folders.
It works on both Windows and Linux, it arranges your files and classfy them according to their extensions in their specific folders.

I don't know why did I choose to build such a simple project in C, I can literally use a high level language and it's gonna be much easier, it may be just for learning purposes, or I am a masochist.... or both.
